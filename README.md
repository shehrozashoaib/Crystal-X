# Crystal-X: A GNN-Based Approach for Accurate Band Gap Prediction

![Crystal-X Model](Untitled Diagram (1).jpg)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Crystal-X is a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model** for **accurate and efficient band gap prediction** in materials science. Traditional methods like **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** are computationally expensive, making large-scale materials screening impractical. Crystal-X leverages **edge-centric convolutions and deep learning** to achieve **state-of-the-art accuracy** with significantly lower computational overhead.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Graph-Based Material Representation**: Models atomic structures as graphs with edge features.
- **Advanced Neural Architecture**: Uses **EdgeConv layers** for **directional atomic interactions**.
- **Fast & Scalable**: Reduces computational time **from hours (DFT) to milliseconds (GNN)**.
- **Superior Accuracy**: Outperforms existing ML models like CGCNN and MEGNet.
